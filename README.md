# BrainsterChallenges_Metodij-Gjorgichkov-FE11

# Check it out! If you go back to the previous commit called "Setup for the challenge," you can see that I've added some interesting functionality to the challenge. After the race is finished, I made the "RACE" button not clickable until we click on the "Start Over" button. I thought about adding this functionality to the race button, but then the "Start Over" button wouldn't be necessary and i think this it's better solution.
